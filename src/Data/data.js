The web site was hosted on a shared hosting account that was compromised by a hacker via compromised Wordpress login credentials. The hacker was able to gain access to the web site and install base 64 encrypted PHP malware which recursively replicated throughout all PHP files and executed on the web site, effectively hijacking the traffic. I was able to recover the bulk of the web site via custom Python code to recursively remove the malware.  Unfortunately, the customers database of blog posts was unrecoverable as the original web developer failed to setup any sort of backup solution. Ultimately, user accounts were reset and we were available to recover a few blog posts using historical internet searches.  A database backup solution was installed, providing daily backups of the database.',

During this time, I also established some cybersecurity policies and guidelines and ultimately their HR team requested I assist in running OSINT research for new employees destined for positions requiring enhanced security clearances. I was able to perform OSINT research on the new employees and provide them with a report of the findings.  Doing this helped narrow down the eligable candidates for the position, ultimately saving time and costs.',

I setup a custom VPN server using OpenVPN, which is used to securely connect to the private network and configured firewall rules to assist in securing access to the private network. End point data backup solutions were also installed to ensure constant backup to the NAS drives.',
